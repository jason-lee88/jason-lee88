### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - Welcome to my Profile
Currently I work as a Software Engineer at Lutron Electronics, working on full-stack applications

Outside of my job, this is where you you will find my secret sauce (I had too) for a lot of the different projects I have worked on.

* I'm working on creating a full-stack platform STEM tutoring platform --> [Merchant Math Tutoring](https://merchantmathtutor.com) | [Repository](https://github.com/jason-lee88/merchant-math-tutoring)
* I wrote an AutoHotkey script to auto-record my favorite games such as VALORANT using OBS, after being disappointed by current clipping & highlight software on the market --> [Repository](https://github.com/jason-lee88/juice-clips)
* I created an application to search popular usernames from the Riot Games platform and calculate the availability based on automated account deletion (and used it to grab my own rare username!) --> [Repository](https://github.com/jason-lee88/riot-name-finder)

See it as you have made it this far and hopefully clicked on the previous links, you might as well contact me
