### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - Welcome to my Profile
Currently I work as a Software Engineer at Lutron Electronics, working on full-stack applications.

Outside of my job, you can find some projects I've created recently below!

* I'm working on creating a full-stack platform STEM tutoring platform --> [Merchant Math Tutoring](https://www.merchantmathtutor.com) | [Repository](https://www.github.com/jason-lee88/merchant-math-tutoring)
* I wrote an AutoHotkey script to auto-record my favorite games such as VALORANT using OBS, after being disappointed by current clipping & highlight software on the market --> [Repository](https://www.github.com/jason-lee88/juice-clips)
* I created an application to search popular usernames from the Riot Games platform and calculate the availability based on automated account deletion (and used it to grab my own rare username!) --> [Repository](https://www.github.com/jason-lee88/riot-name-finder)
* I created a platfom for avid concert-goers to discover new events and connect with other users who share similar interests --> [Beat Buddy](https://beat-buddy-rg8w.onrender.com/) | [Repository](https://www.github.com/jason-lee88/beat-buddy)
